## Adaptability
- Do the structures in the settlement adapt to the terrain?
- Do the structure in the environment reflect the environment, i.e. usage of available material, adaptation to the biome?
- Does the settlement take advantage of terrain features or compensate for problems with the terrain?
- Are the settlements different in reaction to the different initial maps?
- Are there any other ways in how the settlement adapt to the given maps?

## Functionality
- Does the settlement provide protection from danger?
- Does it keep mobs from spawning?
- Does it keep mobs out?
- Protection from other environmental dangers?
- Is the settlement accessible to a player avatar in survival mode?
- Can you walk to everywhere?
- Does the settlement provide faster modes of transport?
- How easy is it to find your way around?
- Does the settlement provide the player with additional affordances?
- Does the settlement makes ressources easy to obtain?
- Is there an easy way to get food?
- Does the settlement provide functionality to the villagers?
- Does the settlement reflect the embodiment of the player avatar?
- Is it appropriately scaled?

## Narrative
- Is the settlement evoking an interesting story?
- After looking at the settlement, could you give a short description of what this settlement is about that sets it apart from other settlements?
- Is it clear what the function of the settlement is?
- Does this function make sense in regards to the terrain and environment it is in? I.e. is the logging camp in a forest, the harbour town at the sea?
- Is the functionality of the settlement supporting this narrative function? I.e. does the fortified frontier settlement have functioning walls, is the farming village equipped with functioning fields?
- Does the final settlement give any indication of how the settlement developed?
- Is is possible to look at the settlement and imagine in what order things where build, or what stages the development of the settlement took?
- Is there an indication of the history of the settlement evident in the structure?
- Are the any convincing and consistent allusion to human cultures or specific points in history that the settlement is modelled after?
- Does the settlement have a culture - either fictional or historical, that is evident from the settlement?
- Do you know things about this culture just by looking at the settlement?

## Aesthetic
- Does the settlement look good?
- Is there a consistent look to the settlement? Does it appear that all structures belong to the same settlement?
- Is there an appropriate level of variation in the existing structures?
- Are there any jarring features that make the settlement look unbelievable?

## Chronicle
Score both questions, take the average
- What is the overall quality of the narrative?
- How well does a given chronicle fit into that specific settlement? Would it matter if you switched the books around between the two settlements, or is it a one size fits is all text?
