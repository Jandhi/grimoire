This file aims to collect different forms of district decoration.

## Decorative Plots
Decorative plots fill in leftover space and make use of it for (mainly) decorative purposes

Classification based on street adjacency:
- IS - Island (surrounded by streets): Pave over
- PI - Peninsula (1 access to street, more street than property): Pave over
- CV - Cove (1 access to street, more property than street): Greenery
- CH - Channel (2+ accesses to street): Pave over
- CR - Court (surrounded by property): Greenery

Relative area sizes (S, M, L) still need to be quantified through tests
